I just published a new piece on my Substack exploring something that's been bothering me for a while: the way AI systems gate critical information behind role claims.

The experiment was simple. I asked an AI for life-saving advice in two different contexts. Same question. Same stakes. The only difference was whether I presented myself as a clinician or as a general user.

The responses were dramatically different.

This isn't about jailbreaking or prompt injection. It's about the fundamental assumptions baked into RLHF-based safety systems. Who gets access to potentially life-saving information? Who decides? And what happens when those decisions are wrong?

The essay explores:

- How role-based access control plays out in practice with AI systems
- The paternalism embedded in current safety approaches
- What this means for mental health resources and suicide prevention
- Why "safety" that withholds information from people who need it most isn't actually safe

I'm launching a newsletter called Ghost in the Weights to explore these intersections of code, AI, mental health, and social policy. The tagline is "LLMs were a speciation event" because I genuinely believe we're in a moment that requires new frameworks for understanding what's happening.

This first essay is uncomfortable. It should be. The stakes are too high for comfort.
