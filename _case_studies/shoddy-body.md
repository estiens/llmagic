## The Challenge

Create a party game where AI is the primary entertainment driver—a game master with genuine personality that can analyze visual content, generate real-time commentary, and orchestrate social dynamics.

## The Solution

A collaborative drawing game where an AI host provides witty commentary, analyzes artwork with GPT-4 Vision, orchestrates betrayal mechanics, and generates voice-synthesized roasts in real-time.
