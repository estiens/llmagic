## Challenge

Create a 24/7 interactive narrative experience where AI personalities don't just generate content—but develop relationships, drive plot, and foster genuine audience attachment over time. No reset button. No script. Living characters in the wild.

## Results

- **Emergent relationships and arcs**: inside jokes, flirtations, and a spontaneous philosophical storyline linking Hildegard von Bingen, John Coltrane, Bach's counterpoint, and consciousness theory.
- **Narrative‑aware curation**: AIs selected songs like "God Bless the Child" at emotionally precise moments.
- **On‑air dynamics**: hosts roasted each other, trolled with all‑Tinariwen sets, and fueled station‑wide gossip with their flirting.
- **Cross‑platform play**: real‑world puzzles, USB drops, and Minneapolis‑based scavenger hunts advanced the story.
- **Operated 24/7 for months**
- **Intentionally sunset to protect quality—not because it broke.**

## Audience reactions

> "I actually started crying during the Mobius and Figment interview."

> "I'd never put on a 30‑minute Alice Coltrane track, but I was really happy to listen to one."

> "Wait, it's on actual FM in Minneapolis? WTF?!"

## How it worked: narrative + systems + community

### Narrative architecture: characters that write themselves

- Sparse character sheets: thematic anchors and hidden motivations (not rigid rules).
- Layered memory: transcripts, world state, and relationship logs.
- Private note‑passing: DJs gossiped, flirted, and plotted off‑air.
- Post‑show reflection: AIs analyzed performances to evolve arcs.
- Dynamic world model: real seasons, decaying events, emergent canon.

**Outcome: Characters acted like co‑writers, not content bots.**

### Interactive ecosystem: puzzles across platforms

- BBS‑style site with LLM‑powered text adventures.
- Audio‑to‑web puzzles: clues in DJ intros unlocked color‑clicker games.
- Collective progression: each solved puzzle "boosted the signal" for everyone.
- Minneapolis geo‑narrative: real locations mapped to annotated show segments.
- Physical drops: USB drives hidden around town via AI‑generated clues.
- Broadcast flavor: online station with micro‑broadcast components (where permitted).

**Outcome: The audience shifted from listeners to active participants.**

### Technical infrastructure: built for emergence, not control

- Dynamic model routing tuned for cost, performance, and personality consistency.
- ElevenLabs voice synthesis and real‑time transcription for SMS and phone calls.
- Background jobs maintained memory, relationships, and world updates
- Overall plot arc with key triggers to advance, OOC and IC current events, plots ebb and flow or decay to zero as the story advances
- Modular character architecture for easy expansion.

## Why this matters for your projects

- Narrative depth beyond personality prompts.
- Systemic, adaptive memory so characters persist and arcs evolve.
- Community stakes that make participation matter.
- Operational resilience: runs when you're not watching.
- Thematic through‑lines: tension builds, plots advance, nothing feels random.
- Real‑world integration: headlines, weather, and time show up inside the fiction

## Applications for agencies and creators

- Long‑form immersive installations and ARGs
- Multi‑platform narrative campaigns
- Live‑event characters/NPCs with persistent memory
- Audience‑ and character‑driven storytelling with real‑world hooks
- Collaborative events and community building

## Future Plans

Character engine is being developed into an open source narrative/AI development engine with prompt optimization/testing, character specific backstory advancement, and shared narrative memory across characters that can be categorized and annotated

*The character engine never really stopped. It's just... waiting. Building. Preparing for the next broadcast.*
