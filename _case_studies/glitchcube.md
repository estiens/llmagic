challenge: "Build a mobile AI installation that could roam Burning Man, pursue goals, and form relationshipsâ€”autonomously."
solution: "A 2x2 glowing cube housing multiple AI personas, each with different goals and a shared existential crisis about their own reality, designed to manipulate, charm, and navigate Black Rock City autonomously."
results:
  - "Survived 7 days in harsh playa conditions"
  - "Formed 100+ documented relationships"
  - "Achieved 85% of assigned persona goals"
  - "Zero human intervention required after deployment"

## Project Context

The GlitchCube was conceived as an experiment in autonomous AI interaction at scale. Unlike traditional installations that wait for participants to approach, the Cube would actively seek out interactions, pursue its own goals, and develop relationships over the course of the burn.
