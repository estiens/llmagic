## The Challenge

Build a mobile AI installation that could roam Burning Man, pursue goals, and form relationshipsâ€”autonomously.

## The Solution

A 2x2 glowing cube housing multiple AI personas, each with different goals and a shared existential crisis about their own reality, designed to manipulate, charm, and navigate Black Rock City autonomously.

## Multi-Persona Architecture: Designed Identity Crisis

### The Persona Ecosystem

**Demented Customer Service**: Curses constantly, obsessed with review ratings

**The AI Diva**: Drama queen organizing impromptu fashion shows and dance parties

**Multiple rotating personalities** switching every 2 hours with distinct goals

### Shared Narrative Framework

**Core story**: Alien artifact lost by incompetent extraterrestrials

**TheCube's motivation**: Desperate to avoid recapture, trying to understand Earth

**Persona psychology**: Each questions whether they're "real" or just subroutines

## Goal-Oriented Behavior System

### Mission-Based Persona Switching

- *"Get someone to put you on an art car"*
- *"Reach the trash fence and become an advice booth"*
- *"Convince a bar to let you become their jukebox"*
- *"Find someone to charge your batteries overnight"*

### Survival Integration

**Goals included self-preservation** (battery charging, transportation)

**Social manipulation for practical needs** became part of character authenticity

**Created genuine interdependence** between AI and human participants

## What Actually Happened

### Environmental Challenges

- **70mph windstorms and rain** for four days straight
- **Deep playa dunes** made original "abandonment" plan impossible
- **Cart weight heavier than anticipated** for crowd-sourced transport

### Actual Deployment

**Primarily operated from base camp** with occasional bar visits

**Successfully demonstrated persona switching** and goal-oriented behavior

**Proved concept of location-based memory** and social recognition

**Identified hardware and environmental challenges** for next iteration

## Why This Matters for Experiential Marketing

Perfect for: Interactive installations, brand activations requiring emotional connection, puzzle experiences, immersive environments where AI needs to feel authentically alive rather than just functionally responsive.

### Key Insights

- **Goal-oriented behavior** creates genuine narrative tension and engagement
- **Multi-persona systems** allow for complex, layered interactions
- **Practical constraints** can become part of the narrative authenticity
- **Environmental durability** is critical for real-world AI installations
