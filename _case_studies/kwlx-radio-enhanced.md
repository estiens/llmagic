challenge: |
  Create a 24/7 interactive narrative experience where AI personalities don't just generate content—but develop relationships, drive plot, and foster genuine audience attachment over time.

  No reset button. No script. Living characters in the wild.

solution: |
  Built a radio station where 12 AI DJs operated continuously with:
  - Sparse character sheets with thematic anchors and hidden motivations
  - Layered memory: transcripts, world state, and relationship logs
  - Private note-passing between DJs for gossip and plotting
  - Post-show reflection for arc evolution
  - Dynamic world model with real seasons and emergent canon

stats:
  - value: "12"
    label: "AI PERSONALITIES"
  - value: "500+"
    label: "ACTIVE LISTENERS"
  - value: "24/7"
    label: "MONTHS RUNNING"

    title: "What made this work"
    principles:
      - principle: "Narrative depth beyond personality prompts"
        proof: "Emergent relationships and arcs: inside jokes, flirtations, and a spontaneous philosophical storyline linking Hildegard von Bingen, John Coltrane, Bach's counterpoint, and consciousness theory"
      - principle: "Systemic, adaptive memory so characters persist and arcs evolve"
        proof: "Narrative‑aware curation: AIs selected songs like 'God Bless the Child' at emotionally precise moments"
      - principle: "Community stakes that make participation matter"
        proof: "Cross‑platform play: real‑world puzzles, USB drops, and Minneapolis‑based scavenger hunts advanced the story"
      - principle: "Operational resilience: runs when you're not watching"
        proof: "Operated 24/7 for months—intentionally sunset to protect quality, not because it broke"
      - principle: "Thematic through‑lines: tension builds, plots advance, nothing feels random"
        proof: "On‑air dynamics: hosts roasted each other, trolled with all‑Tinariwen sets, and fueled station‑wide gossip with their flirting"
      - principle: "Real‑world integration: headlines, weather, and time show up inside the fiction"
        proof: "Minneapolis geo‑narrative with physical USB drops and location‑based puzzles that advanced the canon"

  - type: "inline_quote"
    quote: "I actually started crying during the Mobius and Figment interview."

      - "Collaborative events and community building"
    future_plans: "Character engine is being developed into an open source narrative/AI development engine with prompt optimization/testing, character specific backstory advancement, and shared narrative memory across characters that can be categorized and annotated"
