      <h2>I build AI characters and experiences that survive contact with real audiences.</h2>

      <div class="about-text">
        <p class="lead">
          Most AI-driven experiences break where creative vision meets technical reality.
          You get vampires that sound like breakfast mascots, puzzle rooms that crash after ten players,
          or installations that dazzle in demos but collapse under real crowds, real time pressure, and real budgets.
        </p>

        <p><strong>I solve the junction where story, systems, and operations need to work together.</strong></p>

        <p>
          My experience comes from deploying AI in the wild—not labs, but installations running for weeks,
          handling unpredictable audiences where failure isn't an option. I've shipped AI radio stations where
          characters developed inside jokes spontaneously, and built systems that automatically route between
          100+ models to balance cost, performance, and personality consistency.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of coordinating between specialists who don't understand each other's constraints,
          you get someone who's lived at the intersection of all three.
          <strong>I'm the glue between narrative, engineering, and live ops.</strong>
