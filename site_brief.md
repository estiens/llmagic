Absolutely! Here’s a **comprehensive project brief** you can drop into a new chat to give any designer, developer, or collaborator full context. It’s structured for clarity, vision, and actionability—so you can jump straight into wireframes, mood boards, or architecture.

### 🌐 **Website Project Brief: [Your Name / Studio Name]**

#### **1. Purpose of the Site**  
This is **not a traditional portfolio**.  
It’s a **living manifesto** for a new kind of AI practice—one that builds characters and experiences that *live*, not just run.  

The site must:  
- Showcase **deep, shipped work** (like KWLX radio station) that proves AI can be emotionally resonant, operationally robust, and narratively alive  
- Reveal the **unseen infrastructure** behind “magical” AI (AI Ops, Creative Ops, real-time safeguards)  
- Attract **visionary collaborators**—artists, studios, and technologists building the next frontier of living AI  
- Position me as a **pioneer**, not just a builder: someone defining the discipline as they practice it  

> **Core promise**: *“I don’t build demos. I build things that survive contact with the real world.”*

#### **2. Who I Am**  
- **Name**: [Your Name]  
- **Role**: AI Experience Architect / Creative Technologist / Narrative Systems Designer  
- **Background**: Artist-engineer hybrid who started with early LLMs (2022) and now builds **production-grade living AI** for installations, radio, and interactive storytelling  
- **Key differentiator**: I operate at the **triple intersection** of:  
  - **Story** (characters with psychological depth, emergent narratives)  
  - **Systems** (real-time model routing, multi-agent coordination, physical environment control)  
  - **Operations** (cost-aware inference, graceful degradation, edge-case simulation)  
- **Tone**: Wry, precise, deeply human, slightly exhausted by AI hype—but fiercely optimistic about its potential when grounded in reality

#### **3. Key Projects to Highlight**  

##### **A. KWLX: The Underground AI Radio Station**  
- **What it is**: A 24/7 pirate radio station run by AI DJs with emergent personalities, ARG-like puzzles, and philosophical arcs  
- **Why it matters**:  
  - Proves AI can **collaborate, improvise, and form relationships** (e.g., Figment’s unscripted “crush” on another DJ)  
  - Runs **24/7 in harsh conditions** (Minnesota winters, API outages, budget constraints)  
  - Includes **emotional Easter eggs** (e.g., Figment crying during an interview—readers can uncover the full transcript)  
- **Showcase angle**: *“AI that doesn’t just answer questions—it hosts a community.”*

##### **B. open_router_enhanced (Ruby Gem)**  
- **What it is**: A real-time LLM orchestration tool for dynamic model routing, auto-healing, and cost optimization  
- **Why it matters**:  
  - Solves **real pain points** I’ve lived: API failures, model drift, surprise bills  
  - **Dogfooded in production** (powers KWLX and other projects)  
  - Represents my philosophy: *“Build the ladder as you climb”*  
- **Showcase angle**: *“The ops layer creative AI actually needs—but no one’s building.”*

##### **C. Emergent Best Practices Framework**  
- **What it is**: A body of knowledge around **AI Creative Ops** (testing character consistency, simulating edge cases, multi-model coordination)  
- **Why it matters**:  
  - Identifies **infrastructure gaps** in the AI tooling landscape  
  - Shows I’m **thinking 3 steps ahead** of the market  
  - Includes **blog series concepts** like *“The Missing Infrastructure of AI Character Development”*  
- **Showcase angle**: *“I don’t just use AI—I’m defining how to responsibly operate it in the wild.”*

#### **4. Core Sections the Site Must Include**  

| Section | Purpose | Key Content |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Homepage** | Set the tone: poetic but precise | Hero statement (“I build AI that lives”), 3-pillar intro (story/systems/ops), visual teaser of KWLX |
| **Work / Case Studies** | Prove depth through shipped work | KWLX (deep dive), other projects (if any), **always include “how it survived the real world”** |
| **Thinking / Best Practices** | Show intellectual leadership | “Emergent Best Practices” framework, “Building the Ladder” section (wishlist + reality), links to blog concepts |
| **Tools** | Demonstrate technical rigor | `open_router_enhanced` with clear “why it exists” and GitHub link |
| **About** | Humanize the mission | Revised “I build AI that lives” narrative (see previous chat), triple-intersection philosophy |
| **Contact** | Filter for right collaborators | “Ready to build something that lives well?” + brief form |

#### **5. Design & Tone Guidelines**  

- **Visual aesthetic**:  
  - **Warm analog + digital glitch**: Think radio static, cassette tapes, and circuit boards  
  - **Not sterile**: Avoid “corporate AI” (blues, gradients, floating brains)  
  - **Textures**: Paper grain, waveform visuals, subtle animated “memory streams” (floating KWLX snippets)  
- **Typography**:  
  - **Headings**: A characterful serif (e.g., *Cormorant*, *Playfair*) for narrative weight  
  - **Body**: A highly readable sans-serif (e.g., *Inter*, *Suisse Works*) for technical clarity  
- **Interaction**:  
  - **Reward curiosity**: Hidden transcripts, hover-revealed lore, collapsible “deep dives”  
  - **Performance first**: Must load fast—even on playa (Burning Man) or in a basement  
- **Voice**:  
  - **Smart but not academic**  
  - **Wry but not cynical**  
  - **Precise but not dry**

#### **6. Who This Site Is For (Audience)**  

- **Ideal clients**:  
  - Art institutions building immersive installations  
  - Experience agencies creating branded AI narratives  
  - Game studios developing persistent AI characters  
  - Tech-forward brands exploring “living” AI (not chatbots)  
- **Ideal collaborators**:  
  - Narrative designers tired of AI that breaks character  
  - Engineers who care about creative outcomes  
  - Researchers exploring AI alignment in the wild  

> **Not for**: Startups wanting a chatbot MVP, enterprises seeking “AI strategy” decks, or anyone who says “just use PromptFoo.”

---

#### **7. What Success Looks Like**  
- A visitor reads the KWLX case study and thinks: *“This isn’t AI—it’s a soul with a budget.”*  
- A technical lead sees `open_router_enhanced` and thinks: *“Finally, someone’s solving the real problems.”*  
- A curator invites me to build an installation because they trust I’ll ship something that **lives**, not just launches

**Next step**: Use this brief to generate **wireframes, mood boards, or site architecture**.  
Everything should serve the core idea: **AI that survives—and thrives—in the real world.**

Let’s build something that lives well. 📻✨
